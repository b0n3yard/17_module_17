# An Explanation of Regular Expressions

a regular expression or regex for short are a set of patterns used for manipulating and matching strings. it usualy consists of a mix of regular and specialcharecters that may look confusing at first but are very useful once mastered

## Summary
one of the many types of regular expressions is a string that looks like this /^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/ which is used to matchand validate urls.
it may look like giberish but once broken down it becomes a bit more clear on what regex can do
